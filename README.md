The code first imports a number of libraries, including:

tkinter for creating a graphical user interface (GUI)
speech_recognition for recognizing speech
pyttsx3 for text-to-speech
pywhatkit for sending WhatsApp messages
datetime for getting the current time
wikipedia for getting information from Wikipedia
pyjokes for getting jokes
os for interacting with the operating system
fitz for reading PDF files
webbrowser for opening web pages
The code then defines a number of functions, including:

talk() to speak text aloud
take_command() to listen for a voice command
read_pdf() to read the text from a PDF file
send_whatsapp_message() to send a WhatsApp message
run_atom() to run the main loop of the program
The main loop of the program first greets the user and then listens for a voice command. If the voice command is recognized, the appropriate action is taken. For example, if the user says "play Bohemian Rhapsody", the code will play the song Bohemian Rhapsody on YouTube.

The code also includes a number of features that allow the user to interact with the program visually. For example, the user can send a WhatsApp message by entering the phone number and message in a GUI.

The code is designed to be easy to understand and modify. The comments in the code explain what each section of code does.

Here are some of the things that the code can do:

Play music on YouTube
Get information from Wikipedia
Tell jokes
Read PDF files
Send WhatsApp messages
Shutdown the computer
The code is still under development, but it is already a powerful tool that can be used to do a variety of tasks.# AtomAI
